On using Java to generate assemblycode for microcontrollers.
---------------------------------------------------------------
The coding is object-oriented in that registers are contained within objects. 
The objects also contain code to manipulate the contained registers. 
Operations on registers are then done by calling method on the objects.
The assembly-code is generated when the program is run.
